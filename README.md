A crawler to go through auctions on https://www.ligamagic.com.br/ and save their information
Liga Magic is a Magic: The Gathering website where players can auction cards and other players can buy them. Since I spend a lot of time looking for specific cards, I decided to automatize it.
This crawler access each auction of a specific user and gather its information, such as price, number of bids, time remaining, etc.
The website is for brazilian players, so it's in portuguese.
